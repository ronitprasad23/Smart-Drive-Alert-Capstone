SMART DRIVE ALERT - PROJECT PRESENTATION GUIDE
================================================================================

1. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TILL NOW? (Project Summary)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We have successfully developed the complete 'Admin Module' and the 'Backend Infrastructure' for the Smart Drive Alert system."

Key Achievements to Highlight:
1.  Full-Stack Architecture: 
    -   We integrated a React.js Frontend with a Django REST Framework Backend.
    -   We used PostgreSQL as our production-grade database.

2.  Secure Authentication System:
    -   Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
    -   Secure Login/Logout and Password Change functionality.
    -   Role-based access (admins vs users).

3.  Real-Time Dashboard Implementation:
    -   Built a dynamic Admin Dashboard that fetches real-time data from the database.
    -   Implemented 'Alerts Management' to monitor driver safety (Speeding, Drowsiness).
    -   Implemented 'User Management' to track active and inactive drivers.

4.  System Configuration:
    -   Created a dynamic Settings module where admins can configure the application (e.g., Update App Name, Sensitivity Levels) without touching the code.

5.  Data Integrity:
    -   Ensured that all data shown on the dashboard (User counts, Alert logs) is persistent and fetched directly from the PostgreSQL database.


2. POTENTIAL PANEL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1: Why did you choose React and Django?
A:  "We chose React for its fast, component-based UI rendering which is essential for a real-time dashboard. Django was chosen for the backend because of its built-in security features, scalability, and robust REST Framework which made API development efficient."

Q2: How are you handling User Authentication?
A:  "We are using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, the backend issues an 'Access Token' and a 'Refresh Token'. The frontend stores this token and sends it in the header of every API request to prove identity. This is more secure and scalable than traditional session cookies."

Q3: How does the system handle Alert locations?
A:  "The Alert model stores latitude/longitude or valid address strings. If a specific alert location is missing (e.g., GPS signal loss), our backend logic automatically falls back to the associated Trip's start location to ensure no data is blank."

Q4: Is the data hardcoded or dynamic?
A:  "It is 100% dynamic. We have removed all dummy data. Every user row and alert entry you see on the dashboard is fetched via API from our PostgreSQL database."

Q5: What is the purpose of the 'Accident Zones' feature?
A:  "This feature is designed to use AI models to identify high-risk areas based on historical accident data. Currently, we have implemented the Admin UI to visualize these zones, and the backend integration for the AI model is part of our Phase 2 roadmap."

Q6: How do you secure the 'Change Password' feature?
A:  "We implemented a specific API endpoint that mandates the user to provide their 'Old Password' first. The backend validates this old password using hashing algorithms before allowing any update to the new password."

Q7: What is the future scope of this project?
A:  1. Integration with IoT sensors for real-time vehicle data.
    2. A Mobile App for drivers to receive push notifications.
    3. Advanced Machine Learning models for predictive risk analysis.

PREPARATION TIPS:
- Show, Don't Just Tell: Navigate through the dashboard while speaking.
- Click 'Save' in Settings to prove it works.
- Change a password live to demonstrate security.
