PROJECT DOCUMENTATION: SMART DRIVE ALERT
==========================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
Smart Drive Alert is a backend system built with Django designed to monitor driving behavior, log trips, and provide intelligent safety alerts and analytics. It integrates with AI services to analyze trip data and provide safety feedback.

2. FOLDER STRUCTURE & COMPONENTS
--------------------------------

The project is split into two main directories: `backend/` and `frontend/`.

A. BACKEND (backend/)
   Contains the Django project and applications.

   1. CORE APPLICATIONS (APPS)
      These are modular components of the Django project:

      1. accounts/
         - Purpose: Handles user authentication and profile management.
         - Key Features: Custom user model (if implemented), login/register API endpoints.

      2. vehicles/
         - Purpose: Manages vehicle information.
         - Key Features: Database models to store car details (Make, Model, Year, License Plate).

      3. trips/
         - Purpose: Logs individual driving sessions.
         - Key Features: Records Start Time, End Time, Distance, and Status (Ongoing/Completed).

      4. alerts/
         - Purpose: Generates and stores safety warnings.
         - Key Features:
           - Stores alert types (e.g., Drowsiness, Speeding, Lane Departure).
           - Links alerts to specific Users and Trips.
           - Classifies severity (Low, Medium, High).

      5. analytics/
         - Purpose: Advanced data analysis and AI integration.
         - Key Features:
           - Google Gemini AI Integration (`ai_service.py`).
           - Generates "Safety Scores" and text-based feedback based on trip data.

      6. system_settings/
         - Purpose: Manages global system configurations.
         - Key Features: API endpoints for retrieving or updating system-wide settings.

      7. smart_drive/
         - Purpose: The main configuration folder for the Django project.
         - Key Contents:
           - `settings.py`: Global settings (Database, Apps, Middleware).
           - `urls.py`: Main URL routing.

   2. KEY FILES IN BACKEND ROOT

      1. manage.py
         - The command-line utility for interacting with this Django project (running server, migrations, etc.).

      2. verify_ai.py
         - A standalone script developed to test the AI integration.
         - functionality:
           - Creates a dummy User, Vehicle, and Trip.
           - Generates fake Alerts (Drowsiness, Speeding).
           - Sends this data to Google Gemini API.
           - Prints the AI's safety feedback to the console.

      3. requirements.txt
         - Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.

      4. .env
         - Stores sensitive information like API Keys (GEMINI_API_KEY) and Debug settings.

B. FRONTEND (frontend/)
   The React frontend application.
   - Purpose: Interfaces for User Dashboard, Trip Logs, and Alerts.
   - Key Features: Vite-based React setup.

3. TECHNICAL STACK
------------------
- specific_backend: Django (Python framework)
- database: PostgreSQL 
- ai_integration: Google Gemini (Generative AI)
- authentication: Django REST Framework (likely utilizing JWT or Session auth)

4. HOW TO RUN
-------------
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Start server: `python manage.py runserver`
4. Test AI: `python verify_ai.py`
